# Floodlight-SDN-Controller
Familiarisation with Software Defined Networking. In this lab you will learn how to build SDN applications in the Floodlight SDN controller. You will also learn how to use the mininet simulator that simulates OpenFlow enabled switches in a computer using (Open vSwitch) http://openvswitch.org/ Virtual Switches in the linux kernel. You will start by following the mininet walkthrough and then you will develop an SDN app using the floodlight controller https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ floodlightcontroller/Floodlight+Documentation that configures the switches in a network to block the forwarding of packets to forbidden IP addresses. The application then collects data about the TCP connections to the allowed destination IP addresses. Namely it stores the sizes and arrival times of the first three packets after the TCP handshake and then the duration and byte count of the connection after it stops.
